About Me:
            
    Hello! My Name is Anthony Illescas. I am currently a Junior at CUNY - Lehman College,            
     majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I have never used my programming          
  to create something that I can see work before me and share with family and friends.       
 So far I am enjoiying HTML and studying at my own pace. With taking this class I hope to 
     learn not only HTML and how to create websites but to learn how I can most efficiently 
and effectively teach myself.
                
            
When I am away from work I always think about visiting many countries after college. 
One on my favorite places to think about traveling is Switzerland, I had always wanted to
go and see the mountains and ski for the first time. The second place I would like
to see is Indonesia. With its warm waters and opportines to dive and see the ocean floor 
I would be very much like to travel there. Lastly I would like to visit Ecuador but more specifically
a volcano called "El Chimborazo" which if measured from the earths core, is the Tallest mountain in the world.
